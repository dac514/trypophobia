This game is for casual players who enjoy strategic puzzles and block-dropping mechanics. It‚Äôs a reimagining of the classic ‚Äúfour-in-a-row,‚Äù enhanced with board rotation, gravity, and special chips. Each move demands foresight not just in placing chips, but in anticipating how the board will shift and how gravity will affect chip positions after rotation. Special chips introduce new layers of strategy: destroy chips, trigger chain reactions, and reshape the game in surprising ways.

## Rules

üëÅÔ∏è Get four eyeballs in a row to win.

Wins are only counted **after the rotation finishes**. The board rotates randomly. The next 3 rotations are shown in the upper left.

Press T to toggle special chips.

üí£ Bombs destroy adjacent eyeballs.

üëæ Mushrooms destroy facing eyeballs. Press R to rotate.

Choose "Play Bot" to play against the AI. Choose "Pass & Play" to play against a friend. The AI can take up to 5 seconds to make a move.

When it's your turn, click the column where you want to drop your eyeball.
