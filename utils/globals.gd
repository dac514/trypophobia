Wins are only counted after the rotation finishes. The board rotates randomly. The next 3 rotations are shown in the upper left.

💣 Bombs destroy adjacent eyeballs.

👾 Mushrooms destroy facing eyeballs. Press R to rotate.

Choose "Play Bot" to play against the AI. Choose "Pass & Play" to play against a friend. The AI can take up to 5 seconds to make a move.
